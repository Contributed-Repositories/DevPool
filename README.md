# Developer Pool

A MERN stack application where software developers can create their digital resumes, connect with other
fellow developers and let recruiters know about their skills for the perfect job, with user authentication.

## Getting Started

-   Fork this repo and run the `git clone <forked repo>` command from your terminal/bash
-   Cd into the directories and `npm install`
-   Server will run at PORT 5000    
-   React server will run at PORT 3000
-   `npm run dev`

## Demo

The app has been hosted on heroku [here](https://developerpool.herokuapp.com/).
P.S: You might have to wait for a few seconds for the heroku site to respond.

## Info

-   This is a Social media application exclusively for software developers where they can create portfolios and connect with other developers.
-   There is no exploitation of data, as the app only requires access to your accounts to fetch your unique ID for authentication/authorization purposes, and no personal details(except your registred user name on the social account) is used by the application.
-   The frontend of the app is built using React and I have used Bootstrap classes for styling the components in addition to my local CSS styles.
-   It has been deployed using Heroku's free tier and the Mongodb Atlas's cloud service is used for the database service. The access to the database is restricted to only 1 authorised user, and as mentioned earlier, there is no personal user data stored in it.

Any suggestions are always welcome in the PRs!
